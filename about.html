			<h3>Statement</h3>
			<p>Rock ‚Äôn‚Äô Roll Camp for Girls (RNRC4G) is a 501(c)3 non-profit that amplifies the voices of campers aged 9 ‚Äì 17 as they form bands, learn an instrument, write an original song, and perform together live before an audience of their families, friends, and peers. We provide a fun, fearless, and supportive environment for girls who are cis-female, transgender (regardless of identity), and gender non-binary to explore music, art, and creative self-expression. Our programs of empowerment cultivate youth leadership, encourage the pursuit of positive social change, and contribute to the vitality of our communities. RNRC4G was founded in Portland, Oregon in 2001 and has since grown into a worldwide phenomenon with more than 100 camps in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and Africa.</p>
