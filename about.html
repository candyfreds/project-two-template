			<h3>Our Mission</h3>
			<p>Is to build confidence and self-esteem through music creation and performance, empowering women, girls, and gender expansive folk through collaborative music creation, peer to peer mentoring, and advocacy for an equitable and inclusive society.</p>
		</article>

		<article>
			<h3>Statement</h3>
			<p>Rock ’n’ Roll Camp for Girls (RNRC4G) is a 501(c)3 non-profit that amplifies the voices of campers aged 9 – 17 as they form bands, learn an instrument, write an original song, and perform together live before an audience of their families, friends, and peers. We provide a fun, fearless, and supportive environment for girls who are cis-female, transgender (regardless of identity), and gender non-binary to explore music, art, and creative self-expression. Our programs of empowerment cultivate youth leadership, encourage the pursuit of positive social change, and contribute to the vitality of our communities. RNRC4G was founded in Portland, Oregon in 2001 and has since grown into a worldwide phenomenon with more than 100 camps in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia, and Africa.</p>

      <h3>Our History</h3>
      <p>Rock ’n’ Roll Camp for Girls was founded in 2001 by a Portland State University student as a summer day camp. In 2003, the organization moved into its own space in Northeast Portland and, in an effort to further fulfill the mission of the organization, launched the Girls Rock Institute, an after-school program that provides more opportunities for girls to get involved throughout the year.

      “Girls Rock! The Movie,” a feature documentary following four girls through their experiences at the 2005 Summer Camp, was released nationally in 2008. Chronicle Books published “Rock ‘n’ Roll Camp for Girls: How to Start a Band, Write Songs, Record an Album, and Rock Out!” based on early versions of the Rockin’ Road Map, our Summer Camp program guide, also in 2008.

      Our programming has grown over the years to include Ladies Rock Camp, Hip-Hop Elements, and Rock Camp Studio. We are very proud of our ever-expanding student base and we are honored by the abundant positive press, community pride, and the individual, local business, foundational, and corporate support we have received over the years.

      In the fall of 2012, RnRC4G moved into the historical Interstate Firehouse Cultural Center, in partnership with like-minded music education nonprofit Ethos. By 2013 we teamed up with SW Charter school and operated Summer Camp programming out of their facility for 3 years!

      In 2015, we moved our offices to First Christian Church in SW Portland. FCC has given us an incredible opportunity to run programming and our offices out of the same space. In spring of 2016 we successfully held Ladies Rock Camp for the first time in our new location and are excited to host all four summer camp sessions of rock camp at First Christian Church as well, we are excited to continue supporting and encouraging campers to find their own voice through music and programming this 2016 year!</p>
